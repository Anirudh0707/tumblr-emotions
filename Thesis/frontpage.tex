  \textbf{\large Abstract}
\end{center}
We propose a novel approach to Sentiment Analysis using Deep Neural Networks combining Visual Recognition and Natural Language Processing. Our approach leverages Tumblr posts containing images and text to predict the emotional state, given by a Tumblr tag, of users. Deep convolutional layers extract relevant features of the images and high-dimensional word embedding followed by a recurrent layer process the textual information to accurately infer the emotion of a given Tumblr post. We demonstrate that the network architecture, named Deep Sentiment, learns meaningful relations between visual data and language as it vastly outperforms models using a single modality. We then show that Deep Sentiment can also be adapted to generate images and text representative of an emotion.
