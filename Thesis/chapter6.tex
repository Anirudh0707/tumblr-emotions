\begin{enumerate}
    \item The image will go through the pre-trained Inception model that will extract features from the images.
    \item The text will be embedded in a high-dimensional space with Word2Vec and will be fed to an LSTM.
    \item The two outputs will be combined in a fully-connected layer.
    \item The final layer will give the probability distribution of the emotion of the post.
\end{enumerate}
